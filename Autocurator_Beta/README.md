Installation

In addition to all the scripts in this repository, you will also require a working Google Cloud Services account. Curation can be done using either a VM or CloudML, but these scripts have been optimized for Cloud ML. Additionally, you will require a functional trial array and an empty contact array for your data. These can be created using software found in the Hires Lab repository [HLab_MatlabTools](https://github.com/hireslab/HLab_MatlabTools). The scripts in [HLab_Whiskers](https://github.com/hireslab/HLab_Whiskers) will also need to be added to the MATLAB path to instantiate the trial arrays. 

Clone or download the scripts in this directory as well as the HLab dependencies and add both to the path. Currently the trial contact browser in HLab_Matlabtools is backwards compatible to MATLAB 2013b. The autocurator scripts in here may be compatible with older versions but have not been tested as such.
